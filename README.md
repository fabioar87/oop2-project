Steps to develop this project:
1. RD work
2. Checking some algorithms problems
3. Implement it (unitary test creation)

The main target will be simple. No external library (or at least the minimum external library).
Working on problems using built in collection.
Topic of choice: Graph problem and applications.

## Graph Theory
This project will explore graph algorithms and its implementation using Java language.
