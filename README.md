## Hyperloop network

In this assignment, I am implementing a version of Dijkstra shortest path algorithm, using Java
programming language and exploring some of its modern features brought by version 21. The problem
explored is the deployment of an Hyperloop network in Ireland, connecting the main cities (hubs)
across the Island (considering Northern Ireland cities). The Hyperloop management system should be
able to route a pod (the transportation unity) through an optimized route between two cities in the
network. Along the implementation, some new features in Java 21 are used, and compared with
traditional (or legacy) way to approach. Some of the improvements are the utilization of record
patterns, improving the pattern match for switch statement, sequenced collections and virtual threads
(although I did not use the virtual threads in the project). Based on my previous experience with
functional programming languages, such as Scala, seems a direction towards this paradigm, well
tested and resilient when applied to scenarios like big data, asynchronous processing and concurrent
programming.

### Graph Theory
This project will explore graph algorithms and its implementation using Java language.
